				<p>HealthHero is based out of Mumbai and is founded by a couple who have nurtured three kids and have elderly parents. Access to healthcare services with minimum physical effort is a priority when you have kids and elderlies at home. Hospitals, Doctors, Pharmacies and Pathology Laboratories, as caregivers, need to focus on their core activities so that they can deliver their best to the patients. They are more often tied up in doing non-core activities due to lack of smart solutions that can assist them in handling their routine tasks easily and efficiently.</p>
